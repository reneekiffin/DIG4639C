Requirements: A react application that has three components: a component that contains the other two components. The user is first presented with a component that requests the user's name and has a button for submitting it. The second component greets the user using their name.

The first component should display an error message in red if the user includes a non-alphabet character (such as !@#$%^&*()). a-z or A-Z and a space are valid characters.
