Objective:

Translate your previous component into React Native, removing references to HTML elements and replacing them with their equivalent React Native components.

Lab 2 Requirements:

The project should be located in the "lab2" subdirectory of your git repository on GitHub and the submission commit should be tagged with "lab2."
The project should include all features from lab 1:
A text input and submission button
A greeting that replaces the text submission button if the input is valid
Valid input is a set of characters that can include the space character ' ', characters a-z and A-Z. Any non-alphabetical character is invalid.
Invalid input produces red error text that informs the user that their input wasn't accepted and why.
In addition to the previous features from lab 1, the content should be centered vertically and horizontally.
Note: The following tutorial uses the expo command line tool. You can also develop your application using Expo.io Snack.  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Part 1 focuses on setting up the expo-cli development server, which isn't necessary for testing and deploying React Native Code, but does provide several advantages.
